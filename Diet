<H1> DIET TYPE </H1>
<PALING-LEFT> My favorable diet type is "Vegetarian".<BR>The reason for following a vegetarian diet vary but include health benefits.<BR>
Following a vegetarian diet may reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.<BR>But some vegetarian diets diets may rely too heavily on processed foods with too many calories, fats , and too much sugar.<BR>
Along side the specific diet type i do also follow a particular"AMP", AMP stands for ADAPTIVE MEAL PHASING.<BR>
AMP helps to maintain a proper boby posture, my AMP includes - deal the first meal ,
eat in a 6 to 8 hour window, do break fast with lean protine and veggies , end eating window with a ton of carbs.</PALIGN>
